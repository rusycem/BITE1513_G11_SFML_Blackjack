The blackjack game is a digital adaptation of the popular card game played in casinos. Players aim to achieve a hand value closer to 21 than the dealer's hand without exceeding it. It's a single-player game where the player competes against the computerized dealer.

C++/SFML BLACKJACK was developed by using C++ and SFML in Visual Studio 2022. The development is solely for the use of education and tutorial with no intention of monetization. 

The code is based on the ‪@SilvianAchim‬ CODING BLACKJACK C++/SFML IN VISUAL STUDIO 2019. The wonderful music is from ‪@yadoud‬ Interstellar Arabic Ambient Remix (With pandora). Huge thanks to them, make sure to check out their Youtube channel.
